The risk-free asset: The capital asset pricing model assumes the existence of a risk-free asset.An investment with zero risk
Zero risk = Lower return
X = Expected volatility,Y = Expected Return
Investors will allocate their money between the risk-free and the market portfolio
Market portfolio

#BETA
it helps us quantify the relationship between a security and the overall market portfolio

Company shares and (the market portfolio = All securities in the market (High return,high risk & Low return,low risk))

Recession 5% > The market portfolio > -5%(rate of return) = systematic risk diversification can't prevent

Stock A:-3%
Stock B: -7%

Flourishing economy 9% > The market portfolio > 9%(rate of return) 

Stock A:5% (safer stocks)
Stock B:12% (riskier stocks)

Measuring beta
How to Calculate Beta
To calculate the beta of a security, the covariance between the return of the security and the return of the market must be known, as well as the variance of the market returns.

Aggressive beta >1 riskier in recession 

Are they going to be affected by a recession.

They will be.

People have less money and will drive their old vehicles longer.

Car producers can expect a significant slump in revenues.

This illustrates how a recession can have a different impact on different businesses.

And what about the beta of the two companies Wal-Mart's Bayda is zero point 0 9.

It is almost independent of the behavior of the overall market portfolio.

Ford's Bayda is one point one which makes it a riskier asset.
